# PPPC-Screensharing
A PPPC profile for allowing screen sharing in macOS Catalina, Big Sur and Monterey.

The screensharing function is not managable from MDM platforms yet as Apple restrict this to a user level function. This PPPC can be uploaded to Jamf or other MDM platforms to allow screensharing apps via a custom plist.

This profile originated from another source but I cant find it again I am just updating this one. If you are the original owner please contact me so I can credit you.



# HOW TO

You can download the PPPC Config profile and upload it to your MDM platform or you can copy the code and compile your own profile from the plist.
